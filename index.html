        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology and Nursing ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Marissa Burk. I am a Sociology student at University of California Riverside. I currently play softball here. I aspire to work as a nurse in the NICU so I currently take nursing courses and will attend nursing school once completing my Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. I have always wanted to work with children and I have family and friends that work in the NICU and I instantly knew that is what I wanted to do and work as.  I currently live at home with my family that consists of my mom, dad, sister and three dogs. I am an animal person and want two dobermans one day. I am twenty years old. I have played sports my whole life. I started playing softball when I was four years old. I started playing travel ball at nine years old. When I got into high school, I went to Fontana High school. I played varsity volleyball and softball all four years. Right before graduating I received a scholarship to play at the University Of California Riverside. When I received my acceptance letter from the school over summer I was extremely happy. My hobbies when not playing softball include going to the beach, river, mountains, reading and sleeping. I love going to the beach, it is my favorite place to be because it is so peaceful. I also enjoy the river very much because I love being in the sun all day long and riding seadoos and being on the boat with my family. I love the sand and waves. I also enjoy going to the mountains because I like to hike and explore waterfalls. I do very much enjoy reading books. My favorite author is Colleen Hoover. I have read numerous of her books. I also love to sleep. Being a student-athlete means a pretty crazy and hectic schedule so any chance I get I try to catch up on my sleep. Especially over summertime, i sleep in every day and go to sleep at a decent time and nap usually in the middle of the day for a few hours. This summer, I plan to work with my hitting coach just as I do now except full time and not part time like I do now. I also plan to travel a lot this summer. Last summer I went to north and south carolina, along with las vegas and arizona. This summer I will be going back to north and south carolina, las vegas, arizona, but also to texas and myrtle beach. I enjoy traveling and I think I always will. I love going to new places and seeing new cultures and places. One place I would love to visit in Spain. All of my ancestors are from Spain and I would love to see how beautiful it is there and the life they lived. I would also like to visit their old home. Spain is also nice because they have amazing food and sceneries. This is my life.
